# Jairo's Python Projects repository

Hello there!

Welcome to my personal Python repository. This repository contains my development projects for personal and professional development.

Take a look at my projects:

## CaesarCipher

This is the Caesar Cipher encoding algorithm, which is implemented by using string indexes manipulation and f-strings mainly

## SecretAuction

A Secret Auction script using a list of dictionaries. (This one is perfectly doable using a dictionary only, however, I did want to use both for future reference)

## Calculator

The basic 4 operations calculator, using a dictionary of functions
